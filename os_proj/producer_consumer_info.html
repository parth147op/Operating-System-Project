        <h1>Producer Consumer</h1>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            The Producer-Consumer problem is a classical multi-process synchronization problem, that is we are trying to
            achieve synchronization between more than one process.There is one Producer in the producer-consumer
            problem, Producer is producing some items, whereas there is one Consumer that is consuming the items
            produced by the Producer. The same memory buffer is shared by both producers and consumers which is of
            fixed-size. The task of the Producer is to produce the item, put it into the memory buffer, and again start
            producing items. Whereas the task of the Consumer is to consume the item from the memory buffer. <br><br>The
            problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer that shares a common fixed-size buffer use it
            as a queue.
        <ul>
            <li>The producer's job is to generate data, put it into the buffer, and start again.</li>
            <li>At the same time, the consumer is consuming the data (i.e., removing it from the buffer), one piece at a
                time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We can solve this problem by using semaphores. here is a fixed size buffer and the producer produces items
            and enters them into the buffer. The consumer removes the items from the buffer and consumes them. A
            producer should not produce items into the buffer when the consumer is consuming an item from the buffer and
            vice versa. So, the buffer should only be accessed by the producer or consumer at a time.</p>


        <h2>The solution of Producer-Consumer Problem using Semaphore</h2>
        <p>The above problems of Producer and Consumer which occurred due to context switch and producing inconsistent
            result can be solved with the help of semaphores. <br><br>
            To solve the problem occurred above of race condition, we are going to use <strong>Binary Semaphore and
                Counting Semaphore</strong>
            <br><br>
            <strong> Binary Semaphore : </strong>In Binary Semaphore, only two processes can compete to enter into its
            <strong> CRITICAL SECTION </strong>at any point in time, apart from this the condition of mutual exclusion
            is also preserved.
            <br><br>
            <strong> Counting Semaphore:</strong> In counting semaphore, more than two processes can compete to enter
            into its <strong>CRITICAL SECTION </strong> at any point of time apart from this the condition of mutual
            exclusion is also preserved.
            <br><br>
            There are three semaphore variables that we use to solve the problems that occur in the Producer-Consumer
            problem:
        <ul>
            <li>Semaphore S</li>
            <li>Semaphore E</li>
            <li>Semaphore F</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong> Semaphore S :</strong> With the help of the Semaphore 'S' variable, we can achieve mutual exclusion
            among the processes. By using the Semaphore variable 'S' the producer or consumer can access and use the
            shared buffer at a specific time. Initially, the value of the Semaphore variable 'S' is set to 1. <br><br>
            <strong>Semaphore E : </strong> With the help of the Semaphore 'E' variable, we can define the vacant
            (empty) space in the memory buffer. Initially, the value of the Semaphore 'E' variable is set to 'n' because
            initially, the memory buffer is empty. <br><br>

            <strong>Semaphore F : </strong> - We use Semaphore 'F' variable to define the filled space, which is filled
            by the producer. Firstly, we set the value of Semaphore variable 'F' to 0 because in starting, no space is
            filled by the producer.
